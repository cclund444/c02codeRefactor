            My name is Caleb Lund. Today I am 29 years old and thankfull. At age 23, a week away from finishing my initial degree, I was in a bad accident.
            After 56 days in a hospital, years of recovery, getting shorty and more able each day. I was able to graduate in 2019 with a different degree. 
            Long story short, after this near death experience, this second time around, I am blessed and moving foreward. Some qualities I pocess and excel in;
            dedicated, hardworker, task-oriented, vocal, motivated, a leader, cooperative, willing to share, an overcomer, determaned and more. I am an open 
            book, I speak and only want to hear the truth. This opportunity will help me continue to grow and ecell in life. Thank you for you time.
